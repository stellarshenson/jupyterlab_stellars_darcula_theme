1. **Task - Darcula Theme Build and Publish**: Fixed linting errors and published theme to npm and PyPI<br>
    **Result**: Fixed 86 linting errors in jupyterlab_stellars_darcula_theme - ran prettier and stylelint auto-fixes for CSS formatting (quotes, spacing, line breaks), fixed number precision (0.83333 to 0.8333 in variables.css), added stylelint exceptions for external CodeMirror class names. Changed package scope from @stellars to @stellarshenson due to npm org permissions. Updated package.json and src/index.ts with new scoped name, rebuilt with yarn and jlpm after clean reinstall. Added standardized badges to README.md following GITHUB.md guidelines - GitHub Actions build status, npm version badge, and PyPI version badge. Successfully published version 1.0.26 to both npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellarshenson/jupyterlab_darcula_theme) and PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/stellars-jupyterlab-darcula-theme/1.0.26/). Verified make publish now works for both registries. Committed changes with message "feat: update package scope and add badges to README".

2. **Task - Project Configuration Setup**: Established project-specific Claude configuration<br>
    **Result**: Copied CLAUDE.md from workspace to project .claude/ directory. Created local JOURNAL.md in project tracking darcula theme work (entry #1). Removed darcula theme entry #15 from workspace journal to restore proper project boundary separation. Committed .claude/CLAUDE.md and .claude/JOURNAL.md with message "chore: add project-specific claude configuration".

3. **Task - Add PyPI Downloads Badge**: Added PyPI downloads badge to README and published new version<br>
    **Result**: Added PyPI downloads badge to README.md using shields.io format (https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/stellars-jupyterlab-darcula-theme). Executed make publish successfully - built and published version 1.0.28 to both npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellarshenson/jupyterlab_darcula_theme/v/1.0.28) and PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/stellars-jupyterlab-darcula-theme/1.0.28/).
